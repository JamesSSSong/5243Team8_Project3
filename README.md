# Project 3 : A/B Test

Deployed Web App: https://ruoshi-zhang.shinyapps.io/Project3_AB_test/

## Project Overview

This project implements an A/B test using a Shiny web application called *Interactive Data Analysis App*. Users were randomly assigned to each version via URL query parameters, and user engagement was tracked using Google Analytics. Key events, including button clicks, bounce rate, and average session time were recorded and compared to determine which version performed better.

## GitHub Files

- **`web_dev (V2).R`**: Contains code for tutorial pop-up window and Google Analytics integration, along with original code for web design. The deployed web link was shared with fellow students in the class  for collecting data.
- `web_dev (V1).R`: Simply the original version from Project 2. It served as the base code for this project.
- `AB_test_codes.qmd`: Includes statistical tests implemented for testing CTR, bounce rate, and session time for both groups.
- `Final_Report.qmd` & `Final_Report.pdf`: Final report files

Please note: Branch `main` contains files for submission. Branch `history` includes all the files each group member worked with and uploaded.
